# Generic Python Weather App
This is a rough draft of a weather app incorporating several libraries and APIs.
 
- [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) - Love it. Beautiful stuff. Also pretty easy to use.
- [TkinterMapView](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/TkinterMapView) - This is an added TKinter component by the above dev for the map portion.
- [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Auotmagically handling complex URL query *AND* parsing JSON stuff? Yes, please.
- [dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) - Used this to obfuscate my API key.
- [AskPython](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/gui-weather-app-in-python) - The tutorial that was the basis upon which I expanded.
- [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) - Used the free OneCall Current Data and GeoCache APIs.
